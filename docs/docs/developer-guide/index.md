# ROAR developer's guide

Write your own ROAR assessment

---

The ROAR app development guide provides documentation for developers of ROAR assessments.
The guide will take you step-by-step through the process of writing your own ROAR app in which participants will identify images representing [hot dogs and "not hot dogs."](https://towardsdatascience.com/hot-dog-or-not-hot-dog-ab9d67f20674)
Please see the [Contributing Guide](../about/contributing.md) for information on contributing to the create-roar-app initializer or to the developer guide itself.

!!! info "This guide uses screencasts"

    Throughout this guide, you will see screencasts like the one below

    <script id="asciicast-FVfBEvHVGqmER95KEwKW0MW3q" src="https://asciinema.org/a/FVfBEvHVGqmER95KEwKW0MW3q.js" async></script>

    As mentioned in the screencast, you can copy text directly from the screencast. These screencasts are made using [asciinema](https://asciinema.org/).

    In the screencasts, you might see us using the [micro text editor](https://micro-editor.github.io/). We chose that because it's a terminal-based text editor that plays nicely with the screencasting software that we use in this guide. You should use whatever text editor you are already comfortable with. If you don't already have a favorite text editor, we recommend [:material-microsoft-visual-studio-code: VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
