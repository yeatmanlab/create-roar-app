# ROAR Glossary

Understanding ROAR terminology

---

We try to use the following terms consistently to reduce confusion when talking about the different components of a ROAR app.

- Trial

    A single stimulus/response pair

- Run

    A globally unique collection of successive trials that constitutes "running" through a ROAR assessment one time

- Corpus

    A named and immutable collection of stimuli

- Block

    A portion of a run whose stimuli are drawn from only one corpus
    ROAR assessments are usually broken up into blocks to give participants a bit of break.

- Task

    A ROAR assessment (e.g., ROAR-SWR, ROAR-MEP, etc.)

- Variant

    A variation of a ROAR assessment (e.g., adaptive vs. random)

- Study

    A collection of runs associated with a research project
